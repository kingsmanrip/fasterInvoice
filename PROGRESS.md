   - Database: SQLite (stored locally in the `data` directory)

## VPS Deployment (March 8, 2025)

1. **Server Setup**
   - Deployed the application on a Hostinger Ubuntu VPS
   - Modified the server port to 7654 to avoid conflicts with other services:
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 7654;
   ```

2. **Build Process**
   - Built the frontend application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Successfully generated optimized static files in the `dist` directory

3. **Systemd Service Configuration**
   - Created a systemd service file for automatic startup and management:
   ```bash
   # /etc/systemd/system/fasterinvoice.service
   [Unit]
   Description=FasterInvoice Application
   After=network.target
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=root
   WorkingDirectory=/root/fasterInvoice
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
   Restart=on-failure

   ```bash
   systemctl status fasterinvoice.service
   ```

5. **Access Configuration**
   - The application is now accessible at:
   ```
   https://mauricioinvoice.site
   ```

6. **HTTPS Implementation (March 8, 2025)**
   - Initially generated a self-signed SSL certificate for the application:
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt -subj "/CN=147.93.119.222" -addext "subjectAltName=IP:147.93.119.222"
   ```
   - Modified the server.js file to use HTTPS:
   ```javascript
   const https = require('https');
   const fs = require('fs');
   
   const options = {
     key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/private.key'),
     cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/certificate.crt'),
     minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
   };
   
   https.createServer(options, app).listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on https://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
   - Added security headers to enhance protection:
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
     res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
     res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'SAMEORIGIN');
     res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
     res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
     next();
   });
   ```
   - Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirection:
   ```javascript
   http.createServer((req, res) => {
     res.writeHead(301, { Location: `https://${req.headers.host}${req.url}` });
     res.end();
   }).listen(HTTP_PORT);
   ```

7. **Domain and Let's Encrypt Setup (March 8, 2025)**
   - Registered domain name: mauricioinvoice.site
   - Configured DNS A record to point to server IP (147.93.119.222)
   - Installed Certbot and Nginx:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx nginx
   ```
   - Obtained Let's Encrypt certificate:
   ```bash
   certbot certonly --standalone -d mauricioinvoice.site
   ```
   - Updated server.js to use the Let's Encrypt certificate:
   ```javascript
   const options = {
     key: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/privkey.pem'),
     cert: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/fullchain.pem'),
     minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
   };
   ```
   - Updated systemd service file to access certificate files:
   ```ini
   ReadWritePaths=/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/
   ReadWritePaths=/etc/letsencrypt/archive/mauricioinvoice.site/
   ```

8. **Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup (March 8, 2025)**
   - Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to enable clean URL (without port number):
   ```nginx
   server {
       server_name mauricioinvoice.site www.mauricioinvoice.site;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7654;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   
       listen 443 ssl;
       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/privkey.pem;
   }
   ```
   - Set up automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection
   - Modified the application to work in HTTP mode when behind Nginx:
   ```javascript
   // For development or when behind Nginx
   app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
     console.log(`HTTP Server running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
   - Updated systemd service to run in development mode for Nginx compatibility:
   ```ini
   Environment=NODE_ENV=development
   ```
   - Successfully implemented clean URL access at https://mauricioinvoice.site
   - Added support for both www and non-www domain versions
   - Certificate renewal is handled automatically by Certbot's scheduled task

## Recent Deployment Updates (March 11, 2025)

1. **Port Configuration Update**
   - Updated the application to run on port 54321 instead of 7654:
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   const PORT = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 7654 : 54321;
   ```
   - This change helps avoid conflicts with other applications and services on the server

2. **Nginx Configuration Fix**
   - Updated the Nginx configuration to correctly proxy requests to the application:
   ```nginx
   # /etc/nginx/sites-available/fasterinvoice
   location / {
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:54321;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
   }
   ```
   - Fixed a 502 Bad Gateway error by ensuring the Nginx configuration points to the correct port
   - Enabled the site configuration for mauricioinvoice.site in Nginx sites-enabled directory

3. **Static File Serving Update**
   - Modified the server.js file to serve static files from the 'dist' directory instead of 'public':
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));
   ```
   - Updated the catch-all route to serve index.html from the 'dist' directory:
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   app.get('*', (req, res) => {
     // Exclude API routes from this catch-all handler
     if (req.url.startsWith('/api/')) {
       return res.status(404).json({ error: 'API endpoint not found' });
     }
     
     // For all other routes, serve the React app
     res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
   });
   ```
   - This ensures the React application built with Vite is properly served

4. **Build Process**
   - Rebuilt the frontend application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Successfully generated optimized static files in the `dist` directory
   - The build process created the following files:
     ```
     dist/index.html
     dist/assets/index-BNJX-rnp.css
     dist/assets/purify.es-Ci5xwkH_.js
     dist/assets/index.es-Dg-H6vvg.js
     dist/assets/html2canvas.esm-CBrSDip1.js
     dist/assets/index-BPf7QQtP.js
     ```

5. **Deployment Workflow Improvements**
   - Established a more robust deployment workflow:
     1. Pull latest code from GitHub repository
     2. Stash any local changes that might conflict
     3. Install dependencies
     4. Build the frontend
     5. Update configuration files as needed
     6. Restart the application

6. **Application Access**
   - The application is now accessible at:
   ```
   https://mauricioinvoice.site
   ```
   - The site uses HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt

## UI Improvements (March 11, 2025)

1. **Removed Duplicate Navigation Buttons**
   - Removed the redundant "Quick Action Buttons" section from the Dashboard component
   - This change eliminates redundancy as these functions are already available through the bottom navigation bar
   - Improves the mobile user experience by making the UI cleaner and more consistent
   - Follows modern mobile app design patterns by relying on a single navigation system

2. **Streamlined User Interface**
   - The application now has a more focused UI with a single navigation system
   - Bottom navigation bar provides access to all main sections: Home, Clients, Projects, and Invoices
   - Each section still maintains its own "New" or "Create" buttons where appropriate
   - The dashboard now focuses on displaying financial summaries and statistics without distractions

## Recent Updates

### Improved 24/7 Uptime Configuration (March 10, 2025)

1. **Enhanced Systemd Service Configuration**
   - Updated the systemd service configuration to ensure 24/7 uptime with automatic recovery:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=FasterInvoice Application
   After=network.target
   Wants=network-online.target
   StartLimitIntervalSec=500
   StartLimitBurst=5

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=root
   WorkingDirectory=/root/fasterInvoice
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5s
   Environment=PORT=7654
   Environment=NODE_ENV=production
   ReadWritePaths=/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/
   ReadWritePaths=/etc/letsencrypt/archive/mauricioinvoice.site/

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   - Key improvements include:
     - `Restart=always`: Ensures the service restarts automatically in all cases, not just on failure
     - `RestartSec=5s`: Sets a 5-second delay between restart attempts to prevent rapid restart loops
     - `StartLimitIntervalSec=500` and `StartLimitBurst=5`: Allows up to 5 restart attempts within a 500-second interval
     - `Wants=network-online.target`: Ensures the service starts only after the network is fully online
     - `NODE_ENV=production`: Improves performance and stability for the Node.js application

2. **Updated Nginx Configuration**
   - Modified the Nginx configuration to properly handle HTTPS communication with the backend:
   ```nginx
   server {
       server_name mauricioinvoice.site www.mauricioinvoice.site;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:7654;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
           proxy_ssl_verify off;
       }
   
       listen 443 ssl;
       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/privkey.pem;
   }
   ```
   - Key changes:
     - Updated `proxy_pass` to use HTTPS instead of HTTP
     - Added `proxy_ssl_verify off` to allow Nginx to connect to the application's self-signed certificate

3. **Application Server Configuration**
   - The application now runs with both HTTP and HTTPS servers:
     - HTTP server on port 7655 (redirects to HTTPS)
     - HTTPS server on port 7654 (main application server)
   - This dual-server approach ensures secure communication while maintaining compatibility with the Nginx reverse proxy

4. **Monitoring and Recovery**
   - The improved configuration ensures:
     - Automatic recovery from crashes or failures
     - Automatic startup after server reboots
     - Proper handling of network dependencies

   - Enhanced the tax rate input field in the EditInvoiceForm component:
     - Replaced the number input with a mobile-friendly spinner selector
     - Added options from 0% to 20% in 0.5% increments
     - Improved the handling of tax rate values to ensure proper calculations
   - Added the same tax rate spinner to the invoice creation form:
     - Updated the state management to include tax_rate field
     - Implemented tax calculations during invoice creation
     - Ensured consistent user experience between creation and editing forms

2. **Logo Implementation**
   - Created a logo.svg file based on the existing favicon
   - Replaced the text header in the Layout component with the logo image
   - Enhanced the visual branding of the application

These improvements provide a better mobile user experience, particularly for setting tax rates, and enhance the visual identity of the application with a proper logo instead of plain text.

### Workflow Description

1. **Client Creation**: The user starts by creating a client with contact information.
2. **Project Setup**: For each client, the user creates one or more projects with details like hourly rate and description.
3. **Invoice Generation**: The user creates invoices for specific projects, adding line items for services rendered.
4. **Invoice Management**: Invoices go through different statuses:
   - **Draft**: Initial state, can be edited
   - **Sent**: Marked as sent to client
   - **Paid**: Marked as paid by client
5. **Reporting**: The dashboard provides an overview of clients, projects, and invoice statuses.

This workflow enables efficient management of the entire invoicing process from client acquisition to payment collection.

### Typical User Journey

**Initial Setup Phase:**
* User logs into the fasterInvoice application
* User navigates to the Clients section
* User creates their first client by entering contact details (name, email, phone, address)
* User saves the client information

**Project Creation Phase:**
* User selects the newly created client
* User clicks "Add Project" and enters project details:
  * Project name
  * Description of services
  * Hourly rate
  * Project status (active by default)
* User saves the project information

**Invoice Creation Phase:**
* User navigates to the Invoices section
* User clicks "Create Invoice"
* User selects the client and corresponding project
* User enters invoice details:
  * Issue date (current date by default)
  * Due date (typically 30 days after issue)
  * Invoice status (draft by default)
  * Optional notes
* User adds line items to the invoice:
  * Description of service
  * Quantity (hours worked)
  * Rate (auto-filled from project hourly rate)
  * Amount (calculated automatically)
* User reviews the total amount
* User saves the invoice as a draft

**Invoice Management Phase:**
* User reviews the draft invoice
* User makes any necessary adjustments to line items
* User changes the status from "Draft" to "Sent" when ready
* User can generate a PDF of the invoice for sending to the client
* When payment is received, user marks the invoice as "Paid"

**Reporting and Analysis Phase:**
* User returns to the Dashboard to view overall statistics
* User can see:
  * Total number of clients
  * Total number of projects
  * Total number of invoices
  * Recent invoice activity
* User can filter and sort invoices by status, date, or client
* User can track outstanding payments and follow up as needed

This journey represents the core workflow that most users will follow when using the fasterInvoice application, from initial client setup through to payment collection and reporting.
