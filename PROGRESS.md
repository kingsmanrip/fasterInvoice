   // vite.config.js
   server: {
     port: 3000,
     proxy: {
       '/api': {
         target: 'http://localhost:5000',
         changeOrigin: true,
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Starting the Application**
   - Successfully started both frontend and backend servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Frontend running on: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API running on: http://localhost:5000

2. **Application Structure**
   - Frontend: React application with Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Backend: Express.js API
   - Database: SQLite (stored locally in the `data` directory)

## VPS Deployment (March 8, 2025)

1. **Server Setup**
   - Deployed the application on a Hostinger Ubuntu VPS
   - Modified the server port to 7654 to avoid conflicts with other services:
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 7654;
   ```

2. **Build Process**
   - Built the frontend application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Successfully generated optimized static files in the `dist` directory

3. **Systemd Service Configuration**
   - Created a systemd service file for automatic startup and management:
   ```bash
   # /etc/systemd/system/fasterinvoice.service
   [Unit]
   Description=FasterInvoice Application
   After=network.target
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=root
   WorkingDirectory=/root/fasterInvoice
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
   Restart=on-failure
   Environment=PORT=7654
   Environment=NODE_ENV=production
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

4. **Service Activation**
   - Enabled and started the service:
   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable fasterinvoice.service
   systemctl start fasterinvoice.service
   ```
   - Verified the service is running correctly:
   ```bash
   systemctl status fasterinvoice.service
   ```

5. **Access Configuration**
   - The application is now accessible at:
   ```
   https://mauricioinvoice.site
   ```

6. **HTTPS Implementation (March 8, 2025)**
   - Initially generated a self-signed SSL certificate for the application:
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt -subj "/CN=147.93.119.222" -addext "subjectAltName=IP:147.93.119.222"
   ```
   - Modified the server.js file to use HTTPS:
   ```javascript
   const https = require('https');
   const fs = require('fs');
   
   const options = {
     key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/private.key'),
     cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/certificate.crt'),
     minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
   };
   
   https.createServer(options, app).listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on https://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
   - Added security headers to enhance protection:
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
     res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
     res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'SAMEORIGIN');
     res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
     res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
     next();
   });
   ```
   - Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirection:
   ```javascript
   http.createServer((req, res) => {
     res.writeHead(301, { Location: `https://${req.headers.host}${req.url}` });
     res.end();
   }).listen(HTTP_PORT);
   ```

7. **Domain and Let's Encrypt Setup (March 8, 2025)**
   - Registered domain name: mauricioinvoice.site
   - Configured DNS A record to point to server IP (147.93.119.222)
   - Installed Certbot and Nginx:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx nginx
   ```
   - Obtained Let's Encrypt certificate:
   ```bash
   certbot certonly --standalone -d mauricioinvoice.site
   ```
   - Updated server.js to use the Let's Encrypt certificate:
   ```javascript
   const options = {
     key: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/privkey.pem'),
     cert: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/fullchain.pem'),
     minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
   };
   ```
   - Updated systemd service file to access certificate files:
   ```ini
   ReadWritePaths=/etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/
   ReadWritePaths=/etc/letsencrypt/archive/mauricioinvoice.site/
   ```

8. **Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup (March 8, 2025)**
   - Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to enable clean URL (without port number):
   ```nginx
   server {
       server_name mauricioinvoice.site www.mauricioinvoice.site;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7654;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   
       listen 443 ssl;
       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mauricioinvoice.site/privkey.pem;
   }
   ```
   - Set up automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection
   - Modified the application to work in HTTP mode when behind Nginx:
   ```javascript
   // For development or when behind Nginx
   app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
     console.log(`HTTP Server running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
   - Updated systemd service to run in development mode for Nginx compatibility:
   ```ini
   Environment=NODE_ENV=development
   ```
   - Successfully implemented clean URL access at https://mauricioinvoice.site
   - Added support for both www and non-www domain versions
   - Certificate renewal is handled automatically by Certbot's scheduled task

### Workflow Description

1. **Client Creation**: The user starts by creating a client with contact information.
2. **Project Setup**: For each client, the user creates one or more projects with details like hourly rate and description.
3. **Invoice Generation**: The user creates invoices for specific projects, adding line items for services rendered.
4. **Invoice Management**: Invoices go through different statuses:
   - **Draft**: Initial state, can be edited
   - **Sent**: Marked as sent to client
   - **Paid**: Marked as paid by client
5. **Reporting**: The dashboard provides an overview of clients, projects, and invoice statuses.

This workflow enables efficient management of the entire invoicing process from client acquisition to payment collection.

* User enters invoice details:
  * Issue date (current date by default)
  * Due date (typically 30 days after issue)
  * Invoice status (draft by default)
  * Optional notes
* User adds line items to the invoice:
  * Description of service
  * Quantity (hours worked)
  * Rate (auto-filled from project hourly rate)
  * Amount (calculated automatically)
* User reviews the total amount
* User saves the invoice as a draft

**Invoice Management Phase:**
* User reviews the draft invoice
* User makes any necessary adjustments to line items
* User changes the status from "Draft" to "Sent" when ready
* User can generate a PDF of the invoice for sending to the client
* When payment is received, user marks the invoice as "Paid"

**Reporting and Analysis Phase:**
* User returns to the Dashboard to view overall statistics
* User can see:
  * Total number of clients
  * Total number of projects
  * Total number of invoices
  * Recent invoice activity
* User can filter and sort invoices by status, date, or client
* User can track outstanding payments and follow up as needed

This journey represents the core workflow that most users will follow when using the fasterInvoice application, from initial client setup through to payment collection and reporting.
