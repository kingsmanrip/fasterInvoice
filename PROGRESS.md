# fasterInvoice Project Progress

This document tracks the progress and steps taken to set up and run the fasterInvoice application.

## Initial Setup

1. **Repository Cloning**
   - Successfully cloned the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingsmanrip/fasterInvoice.git
   ```

2. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Installed all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Added proxy configuration to the Vite setup to forward API requests from the frontend to the backend:
   ```javascript
   // vite.config.js
   server: {
     port: 3000,
     proxy: {
       '/api': {
         target: 'http://localhost:5000',
         changeOrigin: true,
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Starting the Application**
   - Successfully started both frontend and backend servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Frontend running on: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API running on: http://localhost:5000

2. **Application Structure**
   - Frontend: React application with Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Backend: Express.js API
   - Database: SQLite (stored locally in the `data` directory)

## Testing

1. **Manual API Testing**
   - Created test data via API calls:
     - Created a test client
     - Created a test project
     - Created a test invoice
   - Verified data was properly stored in the database
   - Successfully deleted all test data

2. **Unit Tests Setup**
   - Installed testing libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest supertest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react identity-obj-proxy jest-environment-jsdom
   ```
   - Created test files:
     - `server.test.js` for API endpoint testing
     - `clientModel.test.js` for database model testing
     - `PageHeader.test.js` for React component testing
   - Added Jest configuration in `jest.config.js`
   - Added Babel configuration in `babel.config.js`

## Features Verified

1. **Client Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete clients
   - Client data properly stored in the database

2. **Project Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete projects
   - Projects correctly associated with clients

3. **Invoice Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete invoices
   - Invoices correctly associated with clients and projects
   - Invoice items properly stored

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite with the following tables:
- `clients`: Stores client information
- `projects`: Stores project information with references to clients
- `invoices`: Stores invoice information with references to clients and projects
- `invoice_items`: Stores line items for invoices

## User Workflow

Below is a Mermaid chart that illustrates the typical user workflow in the fasterInvoice application:

### Workflow Description

1. **Client Creation**: The user starts by creating a client with contact information.
2. **Project Setup**: For each client, the user creates one or more projects with details like hourly rate and description.
3. **Invoice Generation**: The user creates invoices for specific projects, adding line items for services rendered.
4. **Invoice Management**: Invoices go through different statuses:
   - **Draft**: Initial state, can be edited
   - **Sent**: Marked as sent to client
   - **Paid**: Marked as paid by client
5. **Reporting**: The dashboard provides an overview of clients, projects, and invoice statuses.

This workflow enables efficient management of the entire invoicing process from client acquisition to payment collection.

### Typical User Journey

**Initial Setup Phase:**
* User logs into the fasterInvoice application
* User navigates to the Clients section
* User creates their first client by entering contact details (name, email, phone, address)
* User saves the client information

**Project Creation Phase:**
* User selects the newly created client
* User clicks "Add Project" and enters project details:
  * Project name
  * Description of services
  * Hourly rate
  * Project status (active by default)
* User saves the project information

**Invoice Creation Phase:**
* User navigates to the Invoices section
* User clicks "Create Invoice"
* User selects the client and corresponding project
* User enters invoice details:
  * Issue date (current date by default)
  * Due date (typically 30 days after issue)
  * Invoice status (draft by default)
  * Optional notes
* User adds line items to the invoice:
  * Description of service
  * Quantity (hours worked)
  * Rate (auto-filled from project hourly rate)
  * Amount (calculated automatically)
* User reviews the total amount
* User saves the invoice as a draft

**Invoice Management Phase:**
* User reviews the draft invoice
* User makes any necessary adjustments to line items
* User changes the status from "Draft" to "Sent" when ready
* User can generate a PDF of the invoice for sending to the client
* When payment is received, user marks the invoice as "Paid"

**Reporting and Analysis Phase:**
* User returns to the Dashboard to view overall statistics
* User can see:
  * Total number of clients
  * Total number of projects
  * Total number of invoices
  * Recent invoice activity
* User can filter and sort invoices by status, date, or client
* User can track outstanding payments and follow up as needed

This journey represents the core workflow that most users will follow when using the fasterInvoice application, from initial client setup through to payment collection and reporting.

## Next Steps

Potential improvements for the application:
1. Containerization for easier deployment
2. Enhanced testing coverage
3. User authentication and authorization
4. Backup and restore functionality for the database
5. PDF export improvements
6. Email notification system for invoices
